# Banking Payroll System 💼

Welcome to the **Banking Payroll System**! This project is designed to manage employee payroll and banking details such as name, salary, and ID, allowing various operations such as salary hikes, name changes, employee insertion, and retrieval of employee information. The platform is implemented using **Hibernate** for database interaction and follows the best practices of object-oriented programming.

---

## 🚀 Features  
🌟 **Highlights**:  
- **Salary Hike**: Modify employee salary with a percentage increase.  
- **Change Name**: Update employee names based on employee ID.  
- **Insert Employee**: Add new employee details into the system.  
- **View Employee Details**: Fetch employee details by ID, name, or salary.  
- **Delete Employee**: Remove employee records by their ID.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Java**: Core programming language for implementing the backend.  
- **Hibernate**: Used for database interaction and object-relational mapping (ORM).  
- **MySQL**: Database for storing employee records.  
- **Scanner**: For input handling in the console.

## ✨ How It Works  
- **Main Interface**: The user is prompted to select various options such as salary hike, employee insertion, name change, or deletion.  
- **Hibernate ORM**: Operations like employee insertion, updates, and deletions interact with a MySQL database using Hibernate for seamless object mapping.  
- **Interactive Input**: Users provide input through the console (using the `Scanner` class) to manage employee records.

---

## 🚧 Future Enhancements  
- **User Interface**: Develop a GUI interface to make it more user-friendly.  
- **Search Functionality**: Allow searching for employees by name, salary, or ID.  
- **Database Expansion**: Add more employee attributes and relationships, like departments, roles, and more.
